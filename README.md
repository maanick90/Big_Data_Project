Job Recommedation in CareerBuilder using Collaberative Filtering

The project involves the design and development of a job recommendation system for Career Builder based on user and job based collaborative filtering. 
Apache Mahout is used to create user and job similarity matrices. User similarity is calculated based on the demographic location, similarity of jobs applied, etc. Job similarity is calculated based on the number of common users applied between them.
Apache Spark is used for implementing the recommendation of similar jobs from the above matrices.
Accuracy is determined for each user by comparing the result set with benchmark results.
